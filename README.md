# Turing complete
To me what this means is having a set of simple instructions that can handle flow control in the programming logic. See [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) on wikipedia

This JavaScript implementation of an instruction stack is simple. There is one Register, A and a set of simple instructions.
